# Web Application

This directory contains the React web application for the Aureynx platform. It provides dashboards, maps, alerts, and reporting for wildlife corridor monitoring.

## Run the app

Use the commands below from this folder.

Development

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

Production build

## Notes

The project uses a path alias so that imports starting with @ resolve to the src directory. Configuration is handled by CRACO without ejecting from Create React App.
